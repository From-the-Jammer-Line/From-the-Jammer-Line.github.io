<p>I’ve been recently working on getting my jumpes higher and farther, and I posted a <a href="">picture of my jump</a> on Instagram. It made the rounds, and I was recently asked for my advice on how to improve jumping. So in this post I’ll go through some common pitfalls and how one can improve their jumps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Knees are everthing:</strong> Your knees are a huge part of the mechanics of jumping. When you go into a jump your knees should be bent, but your sholders back so when you bend your knees into the jump you are squating not leaning forward. Think of yourself in a box then to jump you roll forward, squat down lower into your box, but then you spring straight-up and bring your knees into your chest. This is the second place you need to bend your knees, but brining your knees up into your chest can be hard, and something I’m still working on. Then when you land, your knees should soften the blow by bending for a third time where you squat down to absorb the shock of landing.</p>
<p>The box analogy is all about your center of gravity. Your center of gravity should not change much during a jump. In addition, you should land basically in the same position you started in with your knees bent, back straight, shoulders back, and butt low in a squat position.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Up not forward nor backward:</strong> Jumping is a straight-up motion not a forward or backward motion. Often beginners will jump forward which launches you in to your toes. On roller skates you will most likely end up hitting your toe stops. In addition, it will make landing difficult. Rather than trying to push yourself forward use your momentum while rolling to carry you forward. To jump further go faster!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Off and on skates:</strong> The best way to practice jumping is off skates first. I know, boring! But, it’s all about proper form and building some confidence first. A standing still jump has the exact same mechanics as a rolling jump, and in fact, they are the same thing! So first practice jumps off skates and standing still. Work on bringing your knees up into your chest. Also, work on squatting a little lower each session. Then work on a powerful-snappy-explosive jump to get higher. This will require you to get your squat low, and then explosively jump high.</p>
<p>Jumps are a big part of my off-skates training. I do three exercises to help my height and distance:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Standing jumps as described above. Here is a video of mine:</p>
<p>INSERT VIDEO</p></li>
<li><p>Single-leg jumps. I laterally jump to one leg and then jump off the landing leg as high as I can trying to bring my knee into my chest, and then landing back on that leg. Here is a video of me doing these:</p>
<p>INSERT VIDEO</p></li>
<li><p>Burpees! Everybody loves burpees, right? These are great for getting more power and explosion out of all your movements. This includes jumps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you feel good off skates then try standing-still on-skates jumps. This can be very effective for building proper form, and again, work on getting low into a squat and bringing your knees up into your chest. Finally, roll with it! But, when rolling do the same thing you’ve been practicing standing still. You will do a nice jump. The thing that’s hard about rolling is it adds fear to the mix, but do not let fear stop you if you can jump standing still, then you can jump moving, because they are the same.</p></li>
</ul>
