I've been recently working on getting my jumpes higher and farther,
and I posted a [picture of my jump]() on Instagram.  It made the
rounds, and I was recently asked for my advice on how to improve
jumping. So in this post I'll go through some common pitfalls and how
one can improve their jumps.

- __Knees are everthing:__ Your knees are a huge part of the mechanics
  of jumping.  When you go into a jump your knees should be bent, but
  your sholders back so when you bend your knees into the jump you are
  squating not leaning forward.  Think of yourself in a box then to
  jump you roll forward, squat down lower into your box, but then you
  spring straight-up and bring your knees into your chest.  This is
  the second place you need to bend your knees, but brining your knees
  up into your chest can be hard, and something I'm still working on.
  Then when you land, your knees should soften the blow by bending for
  a third time where you squat down to absorb the shock of landing.
  
  The box analogy is all about your center of gravity.  Your center of
  gravity should not change much during a jump. In addition, you
  should land basically in the same position you started in with your
  knees bent, back straight, shoulders back, and butt low in a squat
  position.

- __Up not forward nor backward:__ Jumping is a straight-up motion not
  a forward or backward motion.  Often beginners will jump forward
  which launches you in to your toes.  On roller skates you will most
  likely end up hitting your toe stops.  In addition, it will make
  landing difficult.  Rather than trying to push yourself forward use
  your momentum while rolling to carry you forward.  To jump further
  go faster!

- __Off and on skates:__ The best way to practice jumping is off
  skates first.  I know, boring!  But, it's all about proper form and
  building some confidence first. A standing still jump has the exact
  same mechanics as a rolling jump, and in fact, they are the same
  thing! So first practice jumps off skates and standing still.  Work
  on bringing your knees up into your chest.  Also, work on squatting
  a little lower each session.  Then work on a
  powerful-snappy-explosive jump to get higher.  This will require you
  to get your squat low, and then explosively jump high.
  
  Jumps are a big part of my off-skates training.  I do three
  exercises to help my height and distance:
  
  1. Standing jumps as described above.  Here is a video of mine:

  2. Single-leg jumps.  I laterally jump to one leg and then jump off
     the landing leg as high as I can trying to bring my knee into my
     chest, and then landing back on that leg.  Here is a video of me
     doing these:

  3. Burpees!  Everybody loves burpees, right?  These are great for
     getting more power and explosion out of all your movements.  This
     includes jumps.
  
  Once you feel good off skates then try standing-still on-skates
  jumps.  This can be very effective for building proper form, and
  again, work on getting low into a squat and bringing your knees up
  into your chest.  Finally, roll with it!  But, when rolling do the
  same thing you've been practicing standing still.  You will do a
  nice jump.  The thing that's hard about rolling is it adds fear to
  the mix, but do not let fear stop you if you can jump standing
  still, then you can jump moving, because they are the same.
